# Guides

This chapter contindains patterns and solutions for common problems encountered
when building web applications.

The problems include:
* [Focusing arbitrary components and HTML Elements](/documentation/guides/focusing)
* [Handling files](/documentation/guides/handling-files)
* [Accessing environment variables](/documentation/guides/environment-variables)
* [Scrolling to different parts of the page](/documentation/guides/scrolling)
* [Handling drag & drop interactions](/documentation/guides/drag-and-drop)
* [Creating drop down menus and panels](/documentation/guides/drop-downs)

_Some of these solutions and patterns for these problems are unique to Elm-UI at
this point, mostly because there are no official way to handle these in pure Elm._

If you have a problem related to web applications and Elm-UI feel free to open
an issue about it [here](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-ui/issues)
and it can be part of this guide.
